## About This Script

This scripts idea is inspiered from Latvian Fivem RolePlay server named "Kalnu Ieleja". I was an admin a while ago and decided to leave because it was too much for me. But no when I am again interested in Lua/Fivem development a wanted to recreate the famose parking script. Big thanks I am saying to ImKompots. The original parking script creator from what I took the inspiaration to recreat this script. This script is not as prefect and optimized as the one that ImKompts created for Kalnu Ieleja. But has the same idea -/+. This is my created code from scratch so there might be some problems with it.

First I wanted to sell this script. I even publised a store side and advertised in cfx forms. But then I ffigured why try to sell? I wont earn from it. So I am deciding to publish it for free.
